.TH pen 1 "26 Jul 2019" "version 1.2.0" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
pen \- encrypt and decrypt files with a password
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pen
[\-h, -v] file [files...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
pen is a lightweight alternatve to PGP for securely encrypting files; it uses
the Argon2 algorithm for key-stretching passwords and NaCl's secretbox for
data encryption. If a filename ends in `.pen`, it will be decrypted rather
than encrypted. Upon successful encryption or decryption, the original file
or .pen file, respectively, is securely removed using shred from GNU coreutils.
If shred is not available, the original file remains untouched.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-h, \-\-help

.TP
\-v \-\-version

.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Shredding the original input may still be insecure due to the underlying
charactersitics of your filesystem. In contexts requiring extremely robust
security, it may be best to consider another option and/or to consult a
professional.
