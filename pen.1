.SH NAME
pen \- encrypt and decrypt files with a password
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pen
[\-h, -v] file [files...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pen is a lightweight alternatve to PGP for securely encrypting files; it uses
the Argon2 algorithm to generate a key from a passphrase and NaCl's secretbox
to encrypt the file. If a filename ends in '.pen', it will be decrypted rather
than encrypted. Upon successful encryption or decryption, the original file
or .pen file, respectively, is removed.

.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Due to the nature of underlying filesystems and their underlying hardware,
no attempt is made to shred the original file before it is removed following
encryption. A determined person or law enforcement agency with access to
your raw disk WILL be able to recover the original file. Therefore, it is
advised that for critical applications you use a more mature solution that
follows stricter security protocols.
